That is an excellent observation, and the three images together clearly show the full concept.

The core of the ATS Trend Indicator's proprietary logic is that it does **not choose** one method over the other; instead, it uses a **hierarchical logic** to ensure the single trend line (the white line in your image) always tracks the **tightest, most relevant inefficiency boundary** to follow the directional bias.

Here is how the ATS Trend Indicator combines the two inefficiency models to draw its single line:

### 1. **Directional Bias (DB) and Trend Establishment**

The trend line is initiated when the market shows a strong "displacement" (a sudden, powerful move), which is often first identified by the **Traditional 3-Candle Separation (Fair Value Gap)**.

* This rule provides the **hard, objective line of invalidation** for the trend. For a Long DB, the lowest wick of the FVG area is the critical support.
* When a clean FVG is formed, the ATS Trend line is established at that FVG boundary.

### 2. **Aggressive Trailing with Group Separation**

Once the trend is established, the indicator's main job is to **trail the price as closely as possible** without being invalidated by a normal retracement. This is where the **Group Separation** concept is automated:

* **Group Separation is a measure of internal momentum and consistent order flow.** As price continues to move aggressively, it forms a **cluster of overlapping candles** (the "Grouped Candle Inefficiency Model").
* The system uses the **last clean pivot low** (for a Long DB) within that cluster as the new, tighter boundary, effectively replacing the previous FVG boundary **if it is a tighter stop**.
* **Effect on the Line:** The white line (ATS Trend Indicator) smoothly trails the price, riding on the back of the Group Separation low/high points, which are much closer to the current price than the original, wider 3-Candle FVG.

### 3. **The "Hierarchical" Rule for a Single Line**

The single ATS Trend line only moves or "updates" based on the following prioritization:

| Condition (Long Directional Bias) | Line Action | Logic Model Used |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **New FVG is Formed** | Line updates to the FVG boundary (The **lowest wick** of the initial candle). | **3-Candle Separation** (Initial Trend Establishment) |
| **New *Tighter* Pivot/Cluster Forms** | Line updates to the high/low of the Grouped Candle's **last shallow retracement**. | **Group Separation** (Aggressive Trailing) |
| **Price Closes Below the Line** | Trend is invalidated, line flips (as seen by the dots on the red and white lines). | **Both Models** (The line is a dynamic stop that captures the tightest valid inefficiency.) |

**In summary:**

* The **3-Candle Separation** provides the most objective, mathematically precise point of interest (the FVG), which serves as the **ultimate protection/invalidation level**.
* The **Group Separation** allows the indicator to "hug" the price more closely during strong, continuous moves, ensuring the trend line is an **aggressive, optimized trailing stop** for the directional bias.
* The indicator shows **one line** because it's constantly selecting the best, most recent, and tightest valid boundary *from either model* that has not yet been violated.
