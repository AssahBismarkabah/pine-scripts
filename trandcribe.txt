foreign okay so again most of my illustrations always start with a box because that's kind of the origination of everything that we're always dealing with okay so an order block when we break out of the box what we're trying to do is we're trying to isolate highs and lows that we can measure deviation from based off of this overall business cycle so when we break out the reason I say like let's say that this like the one we're working with here is 17. Pips right I know that as of the contraction cycle right here from high to low that ins that itself is an order block and I don't say personally I don't say bullish order blocks or bearish order blocks uh like other people I don't I I look at them as neutral the only way I would label it is I would put it in the context of the trend and the overall trend Direction but when I talk about order blocks we're just I'm saying they're they're neutral for for measurements sake right here what I'm talking about is when we break out of here this box for instance on the 30 minute right now that we're dealing with this is about 17 Pips so this order block right here from the high below can either go up 17 Pips or it could come across 17 Pips so what I talk about there's guaranteed movement in this it's going to happen that's the initial order block that we're working with right there as we get what's likely to happen here as we get an expansion out of that and it comes down now the order block has expanded itself too and what we're measuring the order block is the expansion of the this cycle until we get the final hoorah which is going to be the trend so as we come through the low point of the box we have a distance from this high of this low of x amount of Pips right there that is the new confirmed order block size everyone with me still at this point this box has also turned red this has now become a major Master pattern box so our expectation now the way that we look at this is that we are going to eventually deviate 100 percent away from the order block size and this is again this is all coming back the order block there's a it serves a few different purposes but the main purpose that the order block serves is giving us projections of distance that the Market's likely to move we can use those when we're trying to figure out our risk to reward and our expectation for our trades so for instance let's say that this was 17 Pips let's call this one you know let's say that the order block now is is like 22 Pips let's just say I don't know what it is but let's just pretend that that's because we have this little expansion come out of here it you know made that distance there and now we've come back so that from the bottom of the box to that high point is 22 Pips let's say that you're trading this one way or another down you would project that same distance down and try to eyeball that as best I can for 22 Pips so we're now working the bottom side of the order block projection if you were in a trade that's handy knowledge to know especially if the market is overall trending down handy knowledge to know that there's a very very high likelihood that when this finally expands and goes to higher or lower prices and contracts and starts over we're going to go at least 22 Pips so it's really all about coming up with that minimum expectation I want to know how much money is in the deal before I get involved does that make sense as we come down through here let's pretend we don't quite make that we don't make a hundred percent of the order block projection what is that of is that like a great expansion that's happening like if it's running out of juice and we're coming back up especially if we're coming back up into this range right here at the low of the box now we're sitting it right there how much strength is that showing or I should say weakness how much weakness is that really showing to the downside not a whole lot right so going back to the overall framework of what we expect with how we look at the market the market Cycles we didn't even go 100 percent that's this is not a great breakout so far now we're coming in here where's where's the probability lie in this now probably going back up to our expand High Point right so as we go back up we hit that expand High Point now we have two things to happen now we got three legs we have one two three so now this box is green and we have a new order block size because now as it expands we haven't trended we haven't fulfilled the third phase of the market this is just you can think of this as the box that started here from that high and low this is getting into a bigger and bigger box with every leg of expansion you guys with me on that so now we have the distance between here and here okay how many Pips is that and I don't know again this is I'm just drawing this out to illustrate it I would say that that's probably if this is 2022 from there to there this is probably you know we'll call it 34. so now we got a 34 pip order block right there now if we're right here and we're long let's say that the overall trend let's say that the overall trend is long and let's say this is our entry time frame right now if we were undervalued which we would have been at this point right here if we were undervalued on that box we would be looking to catch this move right here that's basic strategy right we have a defined higher time frame going in in a direction we have value that's our directional bias we are now undervalued and we're not exceeding a hundred percent of the order Block it's not strong enough to push the 100 mark so if we catch this coming up back through here or somewhere in this region coming back up and now we're here we have a new order block size from the swing High which you'll have a liquidity line there on the software you also when you get through here you also get a new liquidity line here showing the swing low liquidity lines always go at the blowout points of the market that's the pain threshold so from That Swing Low to coming through this High liquidity line coming through that swing High we have let's call it 34 Pips we project up now try to eyeball this 34 Pips up so as we come up boom through that again we're trying to figure out how much money potentially is in the deal before we get in so if we nail it down here because we're not exceeding the 100 order block down here this gives us clues of what what's really in this market as we come up through here we can stick our entry right here and we know that we we initially need to get through value that's first stop we got to get through value then when we get through value we got to get through liquidity then when we get through liquidity we need that liquidity to be used to boost the market not accumulated so we don't want that that accumulated when we get through there we need to go 100 of the order block so there's phases of this progression that you are looking for as you live through this trade as you get through the top of here if if this is a strong Trend if you guys have done a good job on the higher time frame and looked at the cycle you've done all this work on your higher time frame and you have confidence in those candles over here this you're going to hit these hundred percent order blocks in Trend over and over and over again the trade that I put in the trading floor uh this week that trade I got out because of the order block you guys you guys can go take a look I made a little video on it it went further than that about 40 some Pips but I don't care if I can nail a trade undervalued right here which is great entry great there's all kinds of benefits to entering down here in a lot in a long and I can max out on 100 order block if you guys can do that over and over again you're sitting real good real good foreign
